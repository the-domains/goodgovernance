As the early Saints faced persecution in Missouri, the Prophet Joseph articulated the Lord’s views on the Constitution as he instructed the Saints to seek relief,</p><blockquote><p>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; … And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood. (D&C 101:77, 80)</p></blockquote><p>Earlier the Lord had gone even further and stated that laws passed which are consistent with the Constitution are universal:</p><blockquote><p>And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me. Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land; (D&C 98:5-6)</p></blockquote><p>Note that in this passage the Lord is quite specific that the objective is to support “that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges” or the freedom to choose and to act on those choices. Given this endorsement, it is important to consider what it is about the U.S. Constitution which is inspired. There are<g data-gr-id="77">certainly</g>provisions of the Constitution, such as the acceptance of slavery, which are questionable as universal and “justifiable.” Over the years, the Church has benefited from the reflections on this question by two General Authorities who were also prominent legal scholars: President J. Reuben Clark and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.  Both have discussed what they feel is divinely inspired about the U.S. Constitution. We draw here on the five elements identified by Elder Oaks though they are presented in a slightly different order. (Oaks, Dallin H., “The Divinely Inspired Constitution,”<em>Ensign</em>,<g data-gr-id="80">February,</g>1992)</p><h2><em>Popular sovereignty</em>—</h2><p>Quoting Elder Oaks, “Along with many religious people, Latter-day Saints affirm that God gave the power to the people, and the people consented to a constitution that delegated certain powers to the government.” The Constitution is an expression of the will of “We, the people,” and while certain powers are delegated to government, the people retain the ultimate agency to act and the accountability for our actions.</p><blockquote><p>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. (D&C 101:77-78)</p></blockquote><p>The constitution is intended to protect both the individual and collective agency of the people as well as their individual and collective accountability.</p><h2><em>A written bill of rights</em>—</h2><p>Again, Elder Oaks notes that “… the inspiration was in the brilliant, practical implementation of preexisting principles.” Articulations of basic human rights predated the U.S. Bill of Rights by hundreds of years. The inspired contribution of the Bill of Rights lies in the articulation and elaboration of what the protection of life,<g data-gr-id="64">liberty</g>and property mean. Life, liberty and property are the essential liberties individuals require in order to exercise their agency, and in guaranteeing these rights to all, the Constitution places the well-being of all on an equal footing.</p><h2><em>The rule of law and not of men</em>—</h2><p>In order to exercise agency “pertaining to futurity,” there must be a predictable connection between choices made, actions taken and the consequences of those actions. The equity,<g data-gr-id="63">certainty</g>and stability associated with the rule of law under the Constitution provide the basis for individual liberty. The rule of law also embodies a willingness to place the welfare of all citizens on an equal footing before the law.</p><h2><em>Separation of powers</em>—</h2><p>Elder Oaks draws a distinction between the idea of separating legislative, executive and judicial responsibilities among different office holders on one hand, and the<g data-gr-id="50">adaption</g>of that idea as expressed in the U.S. Constitution. Both he argues are inspired, but the specific<g data-gr-id="51">adaption</g>to U.S. conditions and needs does not preclude a different inspired adaptation in a different context. The separation of powers makes it more difficult for one individual or a small group to abuse their power and infringe on the agency of the governed.</p><h2><em>Division of powers</em>—</h2><p>Elder Oaks states, “This principle of limited national powers, with all residuary powers reserved to the people or to the state and local governments, which are most responsive to the people, is one of the great fundamentals of the U.S. Constitution.” Given that all men have a tendency to curtail the agency of others, dividing powers among different levels of government and different agencies provides an important restraint on abuse and an important support for more localized expressions of the “voice of the people.”</p><p>We observe that the U.S. Constitution embodies a particular<g data-gr-id="69">adaption</g>of these five inspired principles to the needs of the United States, but all five are quite consistent with the three foundational principles and the corollary in establishing freedom to choose and to act, and in placing equal importance on the well-being of all in the law. The implementation of these principles in other contexts will likely vary and should be adapted to the history and needs of the people. The specific institutions, decision processes and mechanisms of government will conceivably differ substantially based on the specific context and history of a people. Thus, a system of judges as existed among the Nephites may work at one time and<g data-gr-id="73">place,</g>while a federalist system with a written constitution was clearly more appropriate for the US context.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="46"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="48"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="49"><span data-reactid="50"><!-- react-empty: 51 --><h2 data-reactid="52"><a data-reactid="53">Good Governance</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="56"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="57"></div></section></div></div>
