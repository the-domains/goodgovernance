Working conclusions about the ends and means of governments derived from the spiritual principles:

1. Universal human flourishing is the ultimate objective
2. Humans flourish in environments which provide
  * A rich array of available options and opportunities
  * Complete information regarding those opportunities
  * The freedom to make personalized choices
3. Governments and other organizations best fill their purpose when they
  * Enhance the range of options available to individuals
  * Provide explanations, information and instruction sufficient to support individual decision making
  * Vigorously support individual freedom of choice consistent with the constraints imposed by the broader society
4. Citizens are accountable for the policies and practices of their governments
