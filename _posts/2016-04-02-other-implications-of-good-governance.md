## Voluntary Associations

The principles that guide the organization, management and conduct of voluntary associations should be grounded in the same three foundation principles: love of all stakeholders, respect for the individual agency of all stakeholders and individual accountability.

Love of all stakeholders implies that all members of the association place the well-being of other members on an equal footing with their own. The further implication therefore is that all members are respected and valued; that their contributions, concerns and needs are carefully weighed and their voices heard; and that actions taken by the organization will be in the best interest of all stakeholders.

Respect for individual agency and accountability implies that each stakeholder has a specific stewardship for some aspect of the association's mission and a broader stewardship for the overall success of the organization and the well-being of all other stakeholders. Within the sphere established by this stewardship, each stakeholder is free to exercise their best judgment and efforts to further the interests of the association and other stakeholders. Each is accountable for both his or her specific stewardship and the achievement of the overall mission of the organization. Willingness to accept this responsibility is the definition of membership in a voluntary association and of citizenship in an involuntary community.

When an individual accepts employment within an organization, the employee enters into a contract with the employer in which the employee accepts certain constraints and requirements associated with the given job in exchange for the income and other benefits associated with regular work. Similarly, when a homebuyer purchases property included within a homeowner's association, the terms and conditions of the buyer's deed include restrictions on how the property may be used, how it must be maintained, etc. In exchange for accepting these restrictions on future choices, the property owner receives the benefits of belonging to the association which may include access to common properties and amenities maintained by the association. Thus, within voluntary organizations, it is often the case that individuals voluntarily choose to restrict their own (future) agency. Inevitably, people subject to restrictions on their agency, whether voluntary or not, encounter conflicts and trade-offs involving the basic rights of individuals.

## Conflicts, Trade-offs and Violations

History has shown that conflicts between rights invariably emerge in communities. Some of these skirmishes result from misunderstandings regarding the nature of the rights involved. Others are more truly conflicts between community members over the relative priority of one right compared to another. Often such conflicts arise because the actions of one community member in pursuing their own interests have unintended or ill-considered effects on others. In such cases, the community must determine how to regulate the implementation and defense of the relative rights involved.  In all cases, societies should enact and enforce laws that defend the minimalist implementation of the three sets of rights regarding conscience, property and life as these are minimally essential for human development.

It is not possible to anticipate all possible conflicts nor to stipulate in the law how they should be addressed. Hence the need for competent public officials with integrity and high personal standards.

> We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. (D&C 134:3)

> Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn. Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; (D&C 98:9-10)

### Taxes

Taxation provides a useful domain in which to consider potential conflicts of rights and how they might be resolved. While taxes inherently infringe on individual agency by limiting property rights, some taxes would be necessary even in a system based largely on fees for service in order to pursue the public interest. A tax system grounded on the three basic axioms would have certain properties, including (but probably not limited to just these):

* It would discourage hoarding (based on love of others)
* It would be completely transparent (based on accountability)
* It would tax negative externalities in order to compensate those harmed (based on love of neighbors)
* It would encourage voluntary redistribution by the relatively well-to-do (based on love of others)

Specific taxes would likely work somewhat differently than at present in the U.S. The property tax would exempt some specified amount of value for residential and active commercial properties, but would provide no exemptions for 2nd homes, vacation homes, vacant commercial property or vacant land. To minimize hoarding of valuable land resources, such non-exempt properties might even be taxed at a higher rate in order to nudge owners to distribute land more evenly and use the land more productively.

To discourage the hoarding of financial resources and encourage voluntary redistribution, the income tax would be progressive exempting some basic income level and taxing the wealthy more heavily, but charitable contributions (voluntary redistribution) would be fully deductible. Both the income and the property tax would be designed to promote a more equal distribution of resources within a jurisdiction.

This is a very cursory consideration of how the implications of the three foundation principles might affect tax policy. It seems certain that other striking implications throughout public and private organizations could be identified and explored more fully.

### Violations

Those living under a government have an obligation to abide by the laws of that government, else the rule of law has little meaning. President David O. McKay expressed that responsibility in these terms:

> The three significant words used in the 12th Article of Faith express the proper attitude of the membership of the Church toward law. These words are---obey, honor, and sustain. The Article does not say we believe in submission to the law. Obedience implies a higher attitude than mere submission, for obedience has its root in good intent; submission may spring from selfishness or meanness of spirit. Though obedience and submission both imply restraint on one's own will, we are obedient only from a sense of right; submissive from a sense of necessity. 
> 
> Honor expresses an act or attitude of an inferior towards a superior. When applied to things it is taken in the sense of holding in honor. Thus, in honoring the law, we look upon it as something which is above selfish desires or indulgences.   
> 
> To sustain signifies to hold up; to keep from falling. To sustain the law, therefore, is to refrain from saying or doing anything which will weaken it or make it ineffective. (McKay, David O., Untitled conference talk, April, 1937)

Breaking the law of the land subjects the perpetrator to sanctions, depending on the severity of the violations.

> We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments; 
> 
> We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; (D&C 134:5, 8)

Violations of the contractual terms connected with voluntary associations are normally punishable by expulsion from the group unless the contract includes an advance agreement allowing for other sanctions. Such additional sanctions cannot extend to taking a life, or violation of other basic human rights. The sanctions are legitimized by the fact that the choice to become a member and to participate in the group was voluntary and was made with full knowledge of all terms and conditions of the relationship.
