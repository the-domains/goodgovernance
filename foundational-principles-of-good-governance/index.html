And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself. For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there—and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just? (D&C 38:24-26)</p></blockquote><p>In both passages, the concept of neighbor and brother is inclusive and is intended to encompass “every man.” (See Haight, David B., “My Neighbor—My Brother!”, General Conference, April, 1987)</p><h2>Individual Agency</h2><p>The second and third principles follow from our understanding of the purpose of life. If freedom to choose and to act on the choices we make is essential for eternal development, then it seems clear that respecting and protecting individual agency is a foundational principle. Elder Dallin Oaks made the distinction between agency as choice and freedom as the ability to act on our choices in an address delivered at BYU in 1987. In his comments, Elder Oaks makes the point that</p><blockquote><p>… [F]ree agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God, conferred on his children and exercised by them in the premortal existence. It is an essential precondition of the further progression we in seek in mortality.(Oaks, Dallin H., “Free Agency and Freedom,” BYU, 11 October 1987, page 5)</p></blockquote><p>He goes on to note that “no person or organization can take away our free agency in mortality,” but what can be constrained “by the conditions of mortality is our <em>freedom</em>, the power to act upon our choices.” (Oaks, page 6. Emphasis in original.)</p><p>Individual freedom to act is curtailed or taken away</p><ol><li>by physical laws, including the physical limitations with which we are born,</li><li>by our own action, and</li><li>by the action of others, including governments. (Oaks, page 6)</li></ol><p>After discussing the ways in which physical limitations and our own actions can limit our ability to act, Elder Oaks makes this observation regarding the restrictions on freedom to act imposed especially by governments.</p><blockquote><p>The science of government is a consideration of the procedures by which and the extent to which the official representatives of one group of citizens can impose restrictions on the freedom of another group. Decisions on the extent to which government power should restrict the freedom of individuals are among the most difficult decisions we face in an organized society. …</p><p>We have to accept some government limitations on freedom if we who live in communities are to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A condition of uninhibited individual freedom would allow the strong to oppress the weak. It would allow the eccentric desires of one person to restrict the freedom of many.(Oaks, pages 6-7)</p></blockquote><p>Agency as the freedom to act on our choices is thus both essential for human development and necessarily constrained by at least some organizations (governments). Protecting the agency of all to the greatest degree possible is a foundational principle for all organizations. As used here, agency also implies self-reliance or full engagement. It is both the ability and the responsibility to act to contribute to the extent possible and improve life both for the individual and for society.</p><h2>Individual Accountability</h2><p>Individual choices and actions are inextricably connected to responsibility for the consequences of those actions. If human development comes through the exercise of individual agency, understood as a cycle of instruction, alternatives, choice, action and consequences, then the third foundational principle must be individual accountability. In an organizational or institutional setting, this individual accountability extends to responsibility for the actions and success of the organization. The definition of a citizen provided by Peter Block resonates with this concept of accountability.</p><blockquote><p>… a citizen is one who is willing to be accountable for and committed to the well-being of the whole. That whole can be a city block, a community, a nation, the earth. A citizen is one who produces the future, someone who does not wait, beg, or dream for the future. </p><p>The antithesis of being a citizen is the choice to be a consumer or a client …(Block, Peter, 2009,Community: The Structure of Belonging, San Francisco: Berrett-Koehler Publishers Inc., page 63)</p></blockquote><p>Thus, the governance of all human interactions and the organizations and institutions that result should ultimately be founded on three basic principles: love of others, individual agency and individual accountability.</p><ul><li>“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” (Matt 22:37-39; D&C 38:23-27; D&C 59:6)</li><li>“… [that] every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.” (D&C 101:78)</li></ul><p>A corollary of these three principles that acknowledges the tendency of most people and organizations to exercise unrighteous dominion can be stated as follows:</p><p>The ability of individuals in a society or organization to infringe on the agency of competent adults should be minimized in both policy and practice.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ms-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="41"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ms-bd-r ms-bd-w-1" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group-heading ms-p-r-4" data-reactid="43"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="44"><span data-reactid="45"><!-- react-empty: 46 --><h2 class="font-title" data-reactid="47"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="48">Foundational Principles of Good Governance</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="49"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ms-f-s-s w-s-wrap ms-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="51"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
