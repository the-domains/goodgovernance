This declaration was approved by a conference of the Church for inclusion in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. While the section has been included in every edition since and is often quoted by Church authorities, the minutes of the conference in which the declaration was read and approved for publication are clear that it was accepted as the “belief, or ‘opinion’ of the officers of the Church” and not as a revelation.[1] At the October, 1928 General Conference of the Church, President Heber J. Grant affirmed that Section 134 is “a declaration of the belief of our Church regarding the governments and laws, …” [2] Because of its long history as the most formal and officially accepted statement of LDS beliefs about government and law, it is also worth careful examination and comparison with the foundational principles articulated here.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="69"><p>The declaration begins by simply stating the belief that “governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.” (D&C 134:1) Latter-day Saints believe there is individual accountability for the collective actions taken by their government[3] as well as specific benefits that flow from well-run governments. This accountability is inescapable and extends both to “making laws and administering them.” Thus, active engagement in the functioning of government is inherent in citizenship.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual-613fbb89-fdf1-4e0d-8ad3-ae22da878012" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="70"><div class="Component ms-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="71"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="72"><div class="System-font " data-reactid="73"><h2 data-reactid="74"><span class="" data-reactid="75"><a class="font-title " href="foundational-principles-of-good-governance" data-reactid="76">Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself</a></span></h2></div><!-- react-empty: 77 --><!-- react-empty: 78 --><!-- react-empty: 79 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="80"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="81"><p>The first foundational principle for human interaction was given by the Savior: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Matt 22:39) In 1831, the Lord reiterated this principle to a conference of early Saints using repetition and a parable to emphasize the point more strongly:</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="82"><blockquote><p>And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practice virtue and holiness before me.

The approach taken is to ground the discussion in scripture and authoritative writings of the modern prophets to the extent possible. In doing so, there is of course the potential for “wresting” the scriptures, especially when considering the implications of the teachings in domains not directly addressed in the texts themselves. Nevertheless, a careful consideration of the principles that should underlie the governance of organizations can provide guidance for both the development and management of those organizations.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="94"><p>To some it may seem that a search for guiding principles for civil society is at best a transitory endeavor. Some may feel that at the advent of the Second Coming all secular organizations and governments will be done away. But not everyone will be a “fellowcitizen with the Saints” during the millennium, [1] and so long as there are “foreigners and strangers,” to continue Paul’s terminology, there will be a need for civil governance structures. It may well even prove to be the case that such civil structures will persist among the Saints if they are grounded in appropriate spiritual principles. And until such time as a more detailed celestial handbook for organizations is revealed from on high, improving governments and organizations merits our attention and effort.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="section-h_HeadingTextual2col-318715d2-d532-4c5a-bb7c-67dde6649884" class="Section Section--components-1 title-size-large color-title text-align-center d-b p-0 ms-p-3 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="95"><div class="Component p-1 " data-reactid="96"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 m-a" data-reactid="97"><div class="System-font m-a" data-reactid="98"><h2 data-reactid="99"><span class="" data-reactid="100"><a class="font-title " href="the-us-constitution" data-reactid="101">Popular sovereignty—</a></span></h2></div><!-- react-empty: 102 --></div><!-- react-empty: 103 --><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 ms-t-a-j col-2 col-gap-s m-a" data-reactid="104"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="105"><p>The U.S. Constitution was divinely inspired and consequently if the foundation principles identified here are correct, they should be abundantly visible in that document.
