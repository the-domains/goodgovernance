This accountability is inescapable and extends both to “making laws and administering them.” Thus, active engagement in the functioning of government is inherent in citizenship.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="4" class="Section Section--components-1 color-title title-size-large p-0 ls-p-h-13vw ls-p-v-8  color-bg text-align-left  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="72"><div class="Component ls-fx-r p-1 " data-reactid="73"><div class="Group Group--heading p-1 fx-2" data-reactid="74"><div class="System-font " data-reactid="75"><h2 data-reactid="76"><span class="" data-reactid="77"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="78">Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself</a></span></h2></div><!-- react-empty: 79 --><!-- react-empty: 80 --><!-- react-empty: 81 --></div><div class="Group Group--textual p-1 fx-1" data-reactid="82"><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="83"><p>The first foundational principle for human interaction was given by the Savior: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Matt 22:39) In 1831, the Lord reiterated this principle to a conference of early Saints using repetition and a parable to emphasize the point more strongly:</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="84"><blockquote><p>And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practice virtue and holiness before me.

The approach taken is to ground the discussion in scripture and authoritative writings of the modern prophets to the extent possible. In doing so, there is of course the potential for “wresting” the scriptures, especially when considering the implications of the teachings in domains not directly addressed in the texts themselves. Nevertheless, a careful consideration of the principles that should underlie the governance of organizations can provide guidance for both the development and management of those organizations.</p></div><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="96"><p>To some it may seem that a search for guiding principles for civil society is at best a transitory endeavor. Some may feel that at the advent of the Second Coming all secular organizations and governments will be done away. But not everyone will be a “fellowcitizen with the Saints” during the millennium, [1] and so long as there are “foreigners and strangers,” to continue Paul’s terminology, there will be a need for civil governance structures. It may well even prove to be the case that such civil structures will persist among the Saints if they are grounded in appropriate spiritual principles. And until such time as a more detailed celestial handbook for organizations is revealed from on high, improving governments and organizations merits our attention and effort.</p></div></div></div></section><section id="7" class="Section Section--components-2 color-title title-size-medium  color-bg text-align-left  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="97"><div class="Component fx-c a-i-center p-2 " data-reactid="98"><div class="Group Group--column min-w-240px max-w-768px p-1" data-reactid="99"><!-- react-empty: 100 --><!-- react-empty: 101 --><div class="System-font " data-reactid="102"><h2 data-reactid="103"><span class="" data-reactid="104"><a class="font-title" data-reactid="105">Popular sovereignty—</a></span></h2></div><!-- react-empty: 106 --><div class="Paragraph " data-reactid="107"><p>The U.S. Constitution was divinely inspired and consequently if the foundation principles identified here are correct, they should be abundantly visible in that document.
