The approach taken is to ground the discussion in scripture and authoritative writings of the modern prophets to the extent possible. In doing so, there is of course the potential for “wresting” the scriptures, especially when considering the implications of the teachings in domains not directly addressed in the texts themselves. Nevertheless, a careful consideration of the principles that should underlie the governance of organizations can provide guidance for both the development and management of those organizations.</p><p>To some it may seem that a search for guiding principles for civil society is at best a transitory endeavor. Some may feel that at the advent of the Second Coming all secular organizations and governments will be done away. But not everyone will be a “fellowcitizen with the Saints” during the millennium, [1] and so long as there are “foreigners and strangers,” to continue Paul’s terminology, there will be a need for civil governance structures. It may well even prove to be the case that such civil structures will persist among the Saints if they are grounded in appropriate spiritual principles. And until such time as a more detailed celestial handbook for organizations is revealed from on high, improving governments and organizations merits our attention and effort.</p><p>Identifying the foundational principles for guiding governments and organizations of all types is made much more feasible if the search for such principles is carried out within the context created by the broader goals and objectives that relate to life itself. With this thought in mind, the discussion begins with a review of basic principles regarding the purpose of life and mortality. A key concept that emerges from this discussion is an understanding of the importance and nature of agency in the eternal scheme and its relationship to self-reliance.</p><p>From the very beginning of mortality, people have formed social units ranging from nuclear and extended families to nation states, with a broad range of voluntary and involuntary organizations in between. The advantages of organized society are discussed briefly and are related to the concepts of agency and self-reliance.</p><p>Three foundational principles are then derived that provide the grounding for the remainder of the discussion. These principles are:</p><ul><li>Individual Agency</li><li>Personal Accountability</li><li>Love of Others</li></ul><p>The relevance of the three principles is subsequently considered in light of the teachings and principles contained in three key sources:</p><ul><li>The teachings of King Mosiah as he led the transformation of his society from a monarchy to a system of judges,</li><li>The inspired principles embedded in the U.S. Constitution, and</li><li>The declaration of LDS beliefs concerning government found in Doctrine and Covenants section 134.</li></ul><p>Section 134 identifies three sets of rights which are held to be essential: the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property and the protection of life. These are not unique to Latter-day Saints, and many others have articulated a similar list. But considering each in light of the three foundational principles provides additional insight into their meaning and importance for organizational governance. These sections are followed by a discussion of conflicts and trade-offs between the principles, compliance enforcement and an example that applies the principles in the field of tax policy.</p><p>The bulk of the discussion relates to government, but the penultimate section provides a discussion of the principles articulated here as they relate to voluntary associations. Concluding thoughts are summarized in the final section.</p><p>Links to other sections:</p><ul><li>The purpose of life</li><li>The purpose of social relations</li><li>Foundation Principles</li><li>Mosiah 29 and the foundation principles: collective agency</li><li>The U.S. Constitution and the foundation principles</li><li>D&C 134 and the foundation principles<ul><li>Free exercise of conscience</li><li>Right and control of property</li><li>Protection of life</li></ul></li><li>Voluntary associations</li><li>Conflicts, trade-offs and violations</li><li>Summary</li></ul><h2>Purpose of Life</h2><p>We take as our starting point the proposition that the purpose of life is to maximize human development and the achievement of human potential.  In his teaching to Moses, God states his purpose in creating and populating the earth.</p><blockquote><p>And the Lord God spake unto Moses, saying: The heavens, they are many, and they cannot be numbered unto man; but they are numbered unto me, for they are mine. … and there is no end to my works, neither to my words. For behold, this is my work and my glory—to bring to pass the immortality and eternal life of man. (Moses 1:37-39)</p></blockquote><p>Joseph Smith taught:</p><blockquote><p>Happiness is the object and design of our existence; and will be the end thereof, if we pursue the path that leads to it; and this path is virtue, uprightness, faithfulness, holiness, and keeping all the commandments of God. [2]</p></blockquote><p>In 1984, Elder Neal A. Maxwell taught in part:</p><blockquote><p>Yes, in the plan, God would have us be happy, but first we had to be free to choose.</p><p>God’s gift to us of this moral agency tells us wonderful things about His beneficial and developmental purposes.[3]</p></blockquote><p>Lehi spelled out the relationship between correct choices and happiness in his teachings to his sons in these words:</p><blockquote><p>Adam fell that men might be; and men are, that they might have joy. And the Messiah cometh in the fulness of time, that he may redeem the children of men from the fall. And because that they are redeemed from the fall they have become free forever, knowing good from evil; to act for themselves and not to be acted upon, … Wherefore, men are free according to the flesh; and all things are given them which are expedient unto man. And they are free to choose liberty and eternal life, through the great Mediator of all men, or to choose captivity and death, according to the captivity and power of the devil; … And now, my sons, I would that ye should look to the great Mediator, and hearken unto his great commandments; and be faithful unto his words, and choose eternal life, according to the will of his Holy Spirit; … (2 Nephi 2:25-28)</p></blockquote><p>This passage is particularly instructive because it identifies the three requirements for obtaining the happiness, joy and eternal life that God desires for his children. First, they must freely choose to accept the Good News of the Gospel. Second, they must act on that decision and live the principles (“hearken unto his commandments; and be faithful”). Finally, it is essential that there be a Messiah to overcome death, the damaging consequences of poor choices by others and the justice of consequences from our own prior poor choices.</p><p>The achievement of God’s plan for his children requires that each have the capacity and the freedom to choose his or her own life’s path and how they will respond to life’s challenges and opportunities. From the creation, men and women have been instructed, given choices, allowed to choose between alternatives and then act on their choices. In the Garden, Adam and Eve were instructed:</p><blockquote><p>Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat, But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it, nevertheless, thou mayest choose for thyself, for it is given unto thee; but, remember that I forbid it, for in the day thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die. (Moses 3:16-17)</p></blockquote><p>And again Lehi’s teachings that agency is based on law are relevant:</p><blockquote><p>And men are instructed sufficiently that they know good from evil. And the law is given unto men. (2 Nephi 2:5)</p></blockquote><p>But also from the creation, the choices people make and their ensuing actions are inextricably connected to consequences for the chooser, and very frequently for others. This connection between the choices we make, the actions we take based on those choices and the consequences that result means that we are responsible for the consequences of our actions. Paul instructed the Galatians:</p><blockquote><p>Be not deceived; God is not mocked: for whatsoever a man soweth, that shall he also reap (Gal. 6:7)</p></blockquote><p>And Elder Dieter F. Uchtdorf expressed a similar thought:</p><blockquote><p>You have agency, and you are free to choose. But there is actually no free agency. Agency has its price. You have to pay the consequences of your choices.[4]</p></blockquote><p>This repeated pattern of instruction, alternatives, choice, action and consequences constitutes human agency and appears to be essential for human learning and development. It is worth stressing again that agency involves the full cycle. It is not simply choosing A over B. The exercise of agency involves taking informed action that changes the future, for better or for worse, and inescapably involves accountability for the consequences that result.</p><p>This emphasis on individual agency and accountability is related to the principle of self-reliance, though the connection may not be immediately obvious. Agency involves both choice and action. Self-reliance also implies action. The concept of self-reliance occurs repeatedly in discussions by church leaders of church aid to the poor. Work and self-reliance are used as two key distinctions between church programs and government assistance programs. Self-reliance is interpreted to mean that one should work to the extent possible. Brigham Young shared this view:</p><blockquote><p>My experience has taught me, and it has become a principle with me, that it is never any benefit to give, out and out, to man or woman, money, food, clothing, or anything else, if they are able-bodied, and can work and earn what they need. . . . This is my principle, and I try to act upon it. To pursue a contrary course would ruin any community in the world and make them idlers.[5]</p></blockquote><p>In some ways self-reliance is a curious doctrine for the church to espouse so thoroughly. In many ways, gospel doctrine emphatically teaches that a person cannot rely solely on his or her own efforts and attain exaltation. Beyond the most obvious need for a redeemer, there are doctrines taught by Joseph Smith that</p><ol><li>we cannot be saved without our dead, nor they without us[6];</li><li>we must be married in order to receive the highest blessings[7]; and</li><li>the saints must gather together.</li></ol><p>Further, it is difficult to conceive of a completely self-reliant person or family if by self-reliance we mean a family that provides for all of their own needs through their own labor. We are now and for the most part have always been interdependent beings. There is so much that we rely on each other for that total self-reliance seems both unattainable and undesirable.</p><p>Both President Marion G. Romney and Elder Alexander Morrison have clarified the role of self-reliance and have stressed that self-reliance is an essential contributor to personal freedom. Elder Morrison has written:</p><blockquote><p>We cannot be free [to act] if we are not self-reliant. Put another way, self-reliance is a prerequisite for freedom, and dependence is the enemy of freedom. The scriptures (D&C 29:24-35) tell us that man is intended by God to be “an agent unto himself.” He cannot do so unless he is self-reliant. Independence and self-reliance thus are critical keys to spiritual growth. Whenever we are in a situation that threatens self-reliance, we will find that freedom is threatened too.</p><p></p><p>Although self-reliance and freedom are tied together, there is nothing spiritual, in and of itself, in being self-reliant. In our laudable strivings to attain self-reliance, we must be careful not to rely too much on the arm of flesh and to remember that we are wholly reliant upon God for all of life's blessings, including life itself. One could be self-reliant—completely independent—and lack every other desirable attribute of character. …</p><p></p><p>Self-reliance, then, is not an end but a means to an end. Self-reliance becomes a factor in spiritual growth only as we use the freedom it brings to make the right choices. In particular, those who are self-reliant are free to serve others.[8]</p></blockquote><p>President Marion G. Romney stressed this link between self-reliance and service to others in the following words:</p><blockquote><p>The key to making self-reliance spiritual is in using the freedom to comply with God’s commandments. The scriptures are very clear in their command that it is the duty of those who<em>have</em>, to<em>give</em>to those who are in need. …</p><p></p><p>We lose our life by serving and lifting others. By so doing we experience the only true and lasting happiness. Service is not something we endure on this earth so we can earn the right to live in the celestial kingdom. Service is the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made. … Can we see how critical self-reliance becomes when looked upon as the prerequisite to service, when we also know service is what godhood is all about?[9]</p></blockquote><p>This connection between self-reliance and service to others may seem paradoxical. If everyone is self-reliant in the sense just related, who are the recipients of all the service being rendered? The resolution of the apparent paradox lies in understanding self-reliance as doing all that we can and contributing all that we can to our own well-being, that of our family and to the society around us. But self-reliance does not mean reliance “on the arm of flesh” or trying to do everything alone. There are many times when cooperation and the acceptance of service from others extends our own ability to do and to contribute. Accordingly, the reasoning and relationship to human development are summarized as follows:</p><ol><li>A person cannot be free to act on their choices if he or she is not self-reliant,[10]and reduced self-reliance reduces our freedom to act independently and contribute all that we might.</li><li>Using our freedom to make correct choices and comply with heavenly commandments makes our self-reliance spiritual because we will choose to serve others.</li><li>Self-reliance as willing and loving service and contributions to the well-being of others as well as ourselves, to the full extent of our capacity is “the very fiber of which an exalted life in the celestial kingdom is made.”[11]</li></ol><p>Agency may be exercised in the pursuit of self-interest or we may choose to serve others and place their well-being on an equal footing with our own. And the concepts of agency and accountability extend beyond individual service rendered to other individuals as discussed in the next section.</p><h2>The Purpose of Social Relations</h2><p>Men and women are most fundamentally social beings by divine intent. Elder Alexander Morrison reiterated this point in a 1998 address:</p><blockquote><p>People are by nature social beings whose lives and feelings are eternally connected and intertwined with those of others. Almost invariably, individuals reach their full potential only in association and in community with others.<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn12" data-mce-href="#_edn12">[12]</a></p></blockquote><p>Human capacities and possibilities are enhanced and greatly extended through cooperation and collaboration as demonstrated throughout history by examples such as the Lord’s consistent command for his people to gather together. Joseph Smith taught:</p><blockquote><p>The greatest temporal and spiritual blessings which always flow from faithfulness and concerted effort,<em>never attended individual exertion or enterprise</em>. The history of all past ages abundantly attests this fact.<em>In addition to all temporal blessings</em>, there is no other way for the Saints to be saved in these last days, [than by the gathering] as the concurrent testimony of all the holy Prophets clearly proves, for it is written—”They shall come from the east, and be gathered from the west; the north shall give up, and the south shall keep not back.” “The sons of God shall be gathered from far, and His daughters from the ends of the earth.”[13]</p></blockquote><p>Thus, collaboration and cooperation support and enhance individual agency and self-reliance by expanding the range of choices and possible actions available to the individual.</p><p>But history is also replete with examples of collective human efforts that undermined and thwarted eternal objectives for human development. Not all participation in organizations and institutions is voluntary and involuntary organizations are particularly prone to infringing on the agency essential for development. Children do not generally volunteer to be part of a family (though they may choose to exit the family at some point), but as nurturing and vital as families can be, they can also thwart development.</p><blockquote><p>Every spirit of man was innocent in the beginning; and God having redeemed man from the fall, men became again, in their infant state, innocent before God. And that wicked one cometh and taketh away light and truth, through disobedience, from the children of men,<em>and because of the tradition of their fathers</em>. (D&C 93:38-39, emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>Those subject to compulsory military service are by definition not volunteers. In most cases, living under a particular government is not a voluntary act. And while some individuals may elect to change the government to which they are subject, it is virtually impossible to escape all government. Even when the purpose of the organization is not explicitly focused on subjugating or constraining its members, human nature and organizational structure all too often tend to combine to elevate some members by suppressing or exploiting others.</p><blockquote><p>We have learned by sad experience that it is the nature and disposition of almost all men, as soon as they get a little authority, as they suppose, they will immediately begin to exercise unrighteous dominion. (D&C 121:39)</p></blockquote><p>While we acknowledge the importance of human nature and individual decisions, our focus is on the governing principles that should guide organizations, with a particular emphasis on governments. There is no question that numerous governments throughout history have exercised “unrighteous dominion” to the detriment and death of millions. It is also clear that this pattern continues today, and many efforts to “reform” government are intended to limit government’s capacity to harm. The question we attempt to answer here takes a more positive approach: On what guiding principles should governments in particular and organizations in general be founded and structured so as to maximize the realization of human potential for all members?</p><p>As noted above in the quotation from Joseph Smith, rich spiritual and temporal blessings flow from our connectedness to others and our mutual reliance. These blessings result in part from individual choices to serve others, but they are also a product of the impact that organizational life has on individual agency. As members of organizations or institutions, we hold some accountability for the impact, both positive and negative, that our organizations have on individuals. Organizations and institutions can both enhance and constrain the agency of individuals.</p><p>Organizations often serve the purpose of simplifying and focusing the range of choices for individuals and become an expression of the individual’s agency. Opting to join a group with a particular agenda or perspective, such as a major political party or volunteering for a service organization, is an expression of the individual’s perspective. It is also true that the choice to affiliate with a group represents at least an initial acceptance of the organization’s perspective on many issues not carefully considered previously by the individual.</p><p>Second, as mentioned, organizations and institutions can broaden the range of choices presented to individuals both through education and socialization and by making options available that would not be obtainable by the individual without cooperation and group resources. Special purpose clubs fill this role, but so do local markets or a well-functioning market economy. Broadening the range of choices also implies that the individual’s ability and capacity to act on their choices is enhanced.</p><p>Third, organizations can constrain individual choices. Such constraints can occur in both voluntary associations such as the workplace or the neighborhood, or through government coercion. Not all such constraints are unrighteous or inappropriate. Some we accept quite voluntarily because they help us achieve other goals. We may accept an employer’s work rules in order to secure employment and the income necessary to provide for ourselves. Other constraints are placed on members of society “to secure the public interest” (D&C 134:5).  Thus, limits may be placed on free speech or other actions that are thought to undermine public safety. But it is also true that some constraints on individual agency and choices are inconsistent with the eternal goal of human development.</p><p>Organizations and society’s institutions should promote human development and enable members to achieve their full potential. The challenge facing all organizations is to recognize when constraints on individual agency help to realize development in a broad sense and when they limit that development. Hence the need for guiding principles.</p><h2>Foundational Principles</h2><h3>Love Thy Neighbor as Thyself</h3><p>The first foundational principle for human interaction was given by the Savior: “Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself.” (Matt 22:39) In 1831, the Lord reiterated this principle to a conference of early Saints using repetition and a parable to emphasize the point more strongly:</p><blockquote><p>And let every man esteem his brother as himself, and practice virtue and holiness before me. And again I say unto you, let every man esteem his brother as himself. For what man among you having twelve sons, and is no respecter of them, and they serve him obediently, and he saith unto the one: Be thou clothed in robes and sit thou here; and to the other: Be thou clothed in rags and sit thou there—and looketh upon his sons and saith I am just? (D&C 38:24-26)</p></blockquote><p>In both passages, the concept of neighbor and brother is inclusive and is intended to encompass “every man.”[14]</p><h3>Individual Agency</h3><p>The second and third principles follow from our understanding of the purpose of life. If freedom to choose and to act on the choices we make is essential for eternal development, then it seems clear that respecting and protecting individual agency is a foundational principle. Elder Dallin Oaks made the distinction between agency as choice and freedom as the ability to act on our choices in an address delivered at BYU in 1987. In his comments, Elder Oaks makes the point that</p><blockquote><p>… [F]ree agency, the power to choose, is a gift of God, conferred on his children and exercised by them in the premortal existence. It is an essential precondition of the further progression we in seek in mortality. [15]</p></blockquote><p>He goes on to note that “no<a href="null"></a>person or organization can take away our free agency in mortality,” but what can be constrained “by the conditions of mortality is our<em>freedom</em>, the power to act upon our choices.” [16] Individual freedom to act is curtailed or taken away</p><ol><li>by physical laws, including the physical limitations with which we are born,</li><li>by our own action, and</li><li>by the action of others, including governments. [17]</li></ol><p>After discussing the ways in which physical limitations and our own actions can limit our ability to act, Elder Oaks makes this observation regarding the restrictions on freedom to act imposed especially by governments.</p><blockquote><p>The science of government is a consideration of the procedures by which and the extent to which the official representatives of one group of citizens can impose restrictions on the freedom of another group. Decisions on the extent to which government power should restrict the freedom of individuals are among the most difficult decisions we face in an organized society. …</p><p></p><p>We have to accept some government limitations on freedom if we who live in communities are to have life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. A condition of uninhibited individual freedom would allow the strong to oppress the weak. It would allow the eccentric desires of one person to restrict the freedom of many. [18]</p></blockquote><p>Agency as the freedom to act on our choices is thus both essential for human development and necessarily constrained by at least some organizations (governments). Protecting the agency of all to the greatest degree possible is a foundational principle for all organizations. As used here, agency also implies self-reliance or full engagement. It is both the ability and the responsibility to act to contribute to the extent possible and improve life both for the individual and for society.</p><p>Likewise, individual choices and actions are inextricably connected to responsibility for the consequences of those actions. If human development comes through the exercise of individual agency, understood as a cycle of instruction, alternatives, choice, action and consequences, then the third foundational principle must be individual accountability. In an organizational or institutional setting, this individual accountability extends to responsibility for the actions and success of the organization. The definition of a citizen provided by Peter Block resonates with this concept of accountability.</p><blockquote><p>… a citizen is one who is willing to be accountable for and committed to the well-being of the whole. That whole can be a city block, a community, a nation, the earth. A citizen is one who produces the future, someone who does not wait, beg, or dream for the future.</p><p></p><p>The antithesis of being a citizen is the choice to be a consumer or a client …[19]</p></blockquote><p>Thus, the governance of all human interactions and the organizations and institutions that result should ultimately be founded on three basic principles: love of others, individual agency and individual accountability.</p><ul><li>“Jesus said unto him, Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart, and with all thy soul, and with all thy mind. This is the first and great commandment. And the second is like unto it, Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself.” (Matt 22:37-39; D&C 38:23-27; D&C 59:6)</li><li>“… [that] every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.” (D&C 101:78)</li></ul><p>A corollary of these three principles that acknowledges the tendency of most people and organizations to exercise unrighteous dominion can be stated as follows:</p><p>The ability of individuals in a society or organization to infringe on the agency of competent adults should be minimized in both policy and practice.</p><p>In order to explore the relevance and potential of the three foundation principles we turn in the next three sections to a consideration of the principles taught explicitly or embedded in three key sources: King Mosiah’s transformation of his society from a monarchy to a system of judges, the U.S. Constitution and the 1835 LDS declaration of belief about government contained in section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants.</p><h2>Mosiah 29 and Collective Agency</h2><p>In 1842 Joseph Smith listed as one of the articles of the LDS faith that, as a people, we believe in being subject to government officials and in “obeying, honoring and sustaining the law.” (AF 1:12) Section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants goes further and states as a belief of the Church that “governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.” (D&C 134:1) A similar collective responsibility for the quality of government was instituted by King Mosiah when he, acting under divine commandment (Hel 4:22), transformed Nephite society from a monarchy to a system of elected judges, ruled ultimately by the consent of the governed. Not only were the judges to be selected by the “voice of the people,” but the people were given the power to “cause” any judge who failed in their administration of the law to be judged by other judges.</p><blockquote><p>And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge. If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people. (Mosiah 29:28-29)</p></blockquote><p>In a righteous system, therefore, the people are accountable for the overall quality of their government.</p><p>Individual agency is a foundational principle. Respecting this principle in an involuntary organization such as a government implies that organizational decisions should be made by the voice of the people. Rulers should be selected and sustained consistent with the popular will.</p><blockquote><p>Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, … (Mosiah 29:25)</p><p></p><p>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. (D&C 134:3)</p></blockquote><p>We often hear discussed the connection between agency and individual accountability in the context of individual actions. Less common are discussions of accountability for the collective consequences of our collective actions. In this regard, the central question seems to concern the limitations placed on majority rule: What burdens, costs and requirements is the majority permitted to impose on a minority? As Elder Oaks noted, some of the most difficult questions we confront are regarding the limits of government. One of the central functions of the U.S. Constitution is to establish such limits within the American context. More generally, however, the collective agency of a people should be respected and sustained. Mosiah places great confidence in the voice of the people, thus respecting the collective agency of a people as well as individual agency.</p><blockquote><p>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law—to do your business by the voice of the people. (Mosiah 29:26)</p></blockquote><p>Taxation, one of the broadest intrusions on individual freedom and property, provides a useful example. A tax system could be designed wherein the people vote on which taxes to adopt and set the range of tax rates while their elected officials determine the final mix and rates necessary to meet fiscal needs. Potential taxes and tax bases could be defined in a publicly approved constitution. Rate ranges can be approved by the electorate. Final rates would be set by elected officials. If the overall tax burden becomes excessive, the “voice of the people” could change either the administration or the underlying laws and rates.</p><p>This example suggests the pattern for resolving this issue of majority power more broadly. Essentially, there are no theoretically imposed limits on what the majority might vote to do in curtailing the property rights of individuals, except that access to and control of property cannot be completely taken away from any individual (see the discussion of D&C 134 below). The agency of groups is expressed through “the voice of the people” and should be respected within the limits established to protect life, freedom of conscience and property rights.</p><p>Mosiah acted according to “that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people.” (Hel 4:22) The Lord’s profound respect for collective agency and the voice of the people can be seen also in his response to the Prophet Samuel when the Israelites asked to have their system of government changed and a king installed. The Lord was not happy with their choice, but it was accepted as a valid exercise of collective agency.</p><blockquote><p>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. (1 Sam 8:6-7)</p></blockquote><p>To be sure, there is collective accountability as well as agency. After expressing confidence in the voice of the people to make generally correct choices, Mosiah states:</p><blockquote><p>And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land. (Mosiah 29:27)</p></blockquote><p>But imposing consequences for wrong collective choices does not in any way diminish the voice of the people as an expression of collective agency.</p><h2>The U.S. Constitution and the Foundation Principles</h2><p>The U.S. Constitution was divinely inspired and consequently if the foundation principles identified here are correct, they should be abundantly visible in that document. As the early Saints faced persecution in Missouri, the Prophet Joseph articulated the Lord’s views on the Constitution as he instructed the Saints to seek relief,</p><blockquote><p>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; … And for this purpose have I established the Constitution of this land, by the hands of wise men whom I raised up unto this very purpose, and redeemed the land by the shedding of blood. (D&C 101:77, 80)</p></blockquote><p>Earlier the Lord had gone even further and stated that laws passed which are consistent with the Constitution are universal:</p><blockquote><p>And that law of the land which is constitutional, supporting that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges, belongs to all mankind, and is justifiable before me. Therefore, I, the Lord, justify you, and your brethren of my church, in befriending that law which is the constitutional law of the land; (D&C 98:5-6)</p></blockquote><p>Note that in this passage the Lord is quite specific that the objective is to support “that principle of freedom in maintaining rights and privileges” or the freedom to choose and to act on those choices. Given this endorsement, it is important to consider what it is about the U.S. Constitution which is inspired. There are certainly provisions of the Constitution, such as the acceptance of slavery, which are questionable as universal and “justifiable.” Over the years, the Church has benefited from the reflections on this question by two General Authorities who were also prominent legal scholars: President J. Reuben Clark and Elder Dallin H. Oaks.  Both have discussed what they feel is divinely inspired about the U.S. Constitution. We draw here on the five elements identified by Elder Oaks though they are presented in a slightly different order.<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn20" data-mce-href="#_edn20">[20]</a></p><h3><em>Popular sovereignty</em>—</h3><p>Quoting Elder Oaks, “Along with many religious people, Latter-day Saints affirm that God gave the power to the people, and the people consented to a constitution that delegated certain powers to the government.” The Constitution is an expression of the will of “We, the people,” and while certain powers are delegated to government, the people retain the ultimate agency to act and the accountability for our actions.</p><blockquote><p>According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment. (D&C 101:77-78)</p></blockquote><p>The constitution is intended to protect both the individual and collective agency of the people as well as their individual and collective accountability.</p><h3><em>A written bill of rights</em>—</h3><p>Again, Elder Oaks notes that “… the inspiration was in the brilliant, practical implementation of preexisting principles.” Articulations of basic human rights predated the U.S. Bill of Rights by hundreds of years. The inspired contribution of the Bill of Rights lies in the articulation and elaboration of what the protection of life, liberty and property mean. Life, liberty and property are the essential liberties individuals require in order to exercise their agency, and in guaranteeing these rights to all, the Constitution places the well-being of all on an equal footing.</p><h3><em>The rule of law and not of men</em>—</h3><p>In order to exercise agency “pertaining to futurity,” there must be a predictable connection between choices made, actions taken and the consequences of those actions. The equity, certainty and stability associated with the rule of law under the Constitution provide the basis for individual liberty. The rule of law also embodies a willingness to place the welfare of all citizens on an equal footing before the law.</p><h3><em>Separation of powers</em>—</h3><p>Elder Oaks draws a distinction between the idea of separating legislative, executive and judicial responsibilities among different office holders on one hand, and the adaption of that idea as expressed in the U.S. Constitution. Both he argues are inspired, but the specific adaption to U.S. conditions and needs does not preclude a different inspired adaptation in a different context. The separation of powers makes it more difficult for one individual or a small group to abuse their power and infringe on the agency of the governed.</p><h3><em>Division of powers</em>—</h3><p>Elder Oaks states, “This principle of limited national powers, with all residuary powers reserved to the people or to the state and local governments, which are most responsive to the people, is one of the great fundamentals of the U.S. Constitution.” Given that all men have a tendency to curtail the agency of others, dividing powers among different levels of government and different agencies provides an important restraint on abuse and an important support for more localized expressions of the “voice of the people.”</p><p>We observe that the U.S. Constitution embodies a particular adaption of these five inspired principles to the needs of the United States, but all five are quite consistent with the three foundational principles and the corollary in establishing freedom to choose and to act, and in placing equal importance on the well-being of all in the law. The implementation of these principles in other contexts will likely vary and should be adapted to the history and needs of the people. The specific institutions, decision processes and mechanisms of government will conceivably differ substantially based on the specific context and history of a people. Thus, a system of judges as existed among the Nephites may work at one time and place, while a federalist system with a written constitution was clearly more appropriate for the US context.</p><h2>D&C 134 and the Foundation Principles</h2><p>Section 134 of the Doctrine and Covenants is a declaration of belief regarding governments and laws. This declaration was approved by a conference of the Church for inclusion in the 1835 edition of the Doctrine and Covenants. While the section has been included in every edition since and is often quoted by Church authorities, the minutes of the conference in which the declaration was read and approved for publication are clear that it was accepted as the “belief, or ‘opinion’ of the officers of the Church” and not as a revelation.<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn21" data-mce-href="#_edn21">[21]</a>At the October, 1928 General Conference of the Church, President Heber J. Grant affirmed that Section 134 is “a declaration of the belief of our Church regarding the governments and laws, …”<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn22" data-mce-href="#_edn22">[22]</a>Because of its long history as the most formal and officially accepted statement of LDS beliefs about government and law, it is also worth careful examination and comparison with the foundational principles articulated here.</p><p>The declaration begins by simply stating the belief that “governments were instituted of God for the benefit of man; and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.” (D&C 134:1) Latter-day Saints believe there is individual accountability for the collective actions taken by their government<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn23" data-mce-href="#_edn23">[23]</a>as well as specific benefits that flow from well-run governments. This accountability is inescapable and extends both to “making laws and administering them.” Thus, active engagement in the functioning of government is inherent in citizenship.</p><p>In order to promote the “good and safety of society,” the declaration states that policies and laws should be adopted and implemented that promote the public interest and protect the individual’s free exercise of conscience.</p><blockquote><p>… all governments have a right to enact such laws as in their own judgments are best calculated to secure the public interest; at the same time, however, holding sacred the freedom of conscience. (D&C 134:5)</p></blockquote><p>The declaration also makes clear a commitment to the rule of law and to quality administration in government.</p><blockquote><p>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign.</p><p></p><p>We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;</p><p></p><p>… that to the laws all men owe respect and deference, as without them peace and harmony would be supplanted by anarchy and terror; human laws being instituted for the express purpose of regulating our interests as individuals and nations, between man and man; (D&C 134: 3, 5, 6)</p></blockquote><p>The declaration goes further and declares that “…for the public peace and tranquility all men should step forward and use their ability in bringing offenders against good laws to punishment,” (D&C 134:8) a view that is quite consistent with the principle of accountability as citizens.</p><p>The declaration identifies three “inherent and inalienable” rights which governments should secure to each individual through the legal system:</p><blockquote><p>We believe that no government can exist in peace, except such laws are framed and held inviolate as will secure to each individual the free exercise of conscience, the right and control of property, and the protection of life. (D&C 134:2)</p></blockquote><p>Thus while the need for governments to curtail individual freedoms is acknowledged in the need to pass and enforce laws “for the good and safety of society,” there is a minimum set of rights necessary for individuals to be able to exercise their individual agency. That set of rights is summarized in the declaration as in other non-church documents before<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn24" data-mce-href="#_edn24">[24]</a>and after the declaration as the protection of life, liberty (free exercise of conscience) and property. The exploration, explication and defense of these rights have occupied volumes, and it is not our objective to review this vast literature here. But it is worthwhile to consider each in light of the foundational principles identified here.</p><h3>Free Exercise of Conscience</h3><p>The declaration of belief contained in section 134 is absolutely clear that men and women are amenable only to God for the exercise of their religion unless their actions infringe on the rights and liberties of others. The law and those who administer it should “never control conscience” nor “suppress the freedom of the soul.” The Constitution also affirms the free exercise of religion.</p><p>But both documents go beyond the individualized practice of personal religion. Section 134 affirms that it is “just to preach the gospel to the nations of the earth, and warn the righteous to save themselves from the corruption of the world.” (D&C 134:12) Consistent with the right to attempt to influence others in religious matters, and with accountability for the quality of governance overall, the Constitution affirms positive rights of free speech, free press, freedom of assembly and of suffrage. Thus, the minimum standard established in these two documents includes both the right to freely exercise one’s personal religion (subject to a similar right for others), and the right to meet, discuss and attempt to influence other members of the community. While section 134 is particularly concerned with religion, clearly the Constitution encompasses a similar right for all efforts to influence other members of society and the government itself. Freedom of conscience then includes both individual and collective agency at least to the extent of free expression and dialogue, and personal practices that do not compel others or infringe on their rights.</p><p>Beyond this minimum, if supported by the popular will, citizens may choose to act through their government to cooperate and facilitate the development of individuals and groups within the population by providing for such things as:</p><ul><li>Basic and/or advanced education for all or part of the population</li><li>Legal requirements which assure equal opportunity for all</li><li>Physical infrastructure such as roads, waterways, etc., to promote the public interest</li><li>A market infrastructure including a common currency, public enforcement of private contracts, etc.</li></ul><p>The only limiting factor on such exercises of collective agency is that all individuals retain certain property rights as discussed in the next section.</p><h3>Right and Control of Property</h3><p>It is possible to conceive of a society in which all social needs are met by voluntary contributions. However, until such a society voluntarily comes into existence, societies must grapple with the difficult question of how the line should be drawn between voluntary actions and government compulsion. Is it permissible to curtail the freedom of one group (through taxes or restrictions on property rights) in order to expand the freedoms of another group (e.g., better education, health care or access to land)? As noted earlier, the answer to these questions is yes, within limits, if approved by the voice of the people. Access to land may be the key case study.</p><p>It may appear that in an industrial society people do not require access to land in order to support themselves. But families need a minimal amount of space in order to live (even if the land area is shared with others by stacking the dwelling units) and work. People also need access to roads and walkways in order to move about and carry out life’s activities. And ultimately land is required to grow crops and the food necessary to feed people and produce materials that are converted into clothing, shelter, etc.</p><p>In the 1830s, the term property was used to describe both material things belonging to a person or group as well as land under one ownership (<em>Oxford English Dictionary</em>). Thus, in reading section 134, it cannot be assumed that the term property applies only to land. At the same time, the right to property does not necessarily imply the right to fee-simple ownership of property. The key right concept may well be the right to access, control and benefit from the materials and land necessary to provide for living space and familial support.</p><p>From one perspective, private ownership of tangible property is inconsistent with scriptures that declare that the “earth is the Lord’s, and the fullness thereof.” (I Cor 10:26; Psalms 24:1; Deuteronomy 10:14). If the earth belongs to God as its creator, then our possession of it is as stewards.</p><blockquote><p>For it is expedient that I, the Lord, should make every man accountable, as a steward over earthly blessings, which I have made and prepared for my creatures. I, the Lord, stretched out the heavens, and built the earth, my very handiwork; and all things therein are mine. (D&C 104:13-14)</p><p></p><p>… [F]or it is required of the Lord, at the hand of every steward, to render an account of his stewardship, both in time and in eternity. For he who is faithful and wise in time is accounted worthy to inherit the mansions prepared for him of my Father. (D&C 72:3-4)</p></blockquote><p>Similarly, scriptures in which God grants possession of certain lands to particular groups as a “land of inheritance” do not appear to contemplate the sale of that land to others. Under the regulations contained in the Torah, for example, in the Jubilee year the Israelite nation was to return all property to its original owner (except the houses of laymen within walled cities). (Leviticus 25)</p><p>The Constitution seems to make clear that a family’s possessions should be safe from unwarranted or unlawful seizure by the government. It seems reasonable to presume that the society would protect an individual’s security of possession from similar seizure by private individuals or entities. Beyond this level of security, a minimal standard in this domain would require that all persons have access to adequate living space for themselves and their family. This requirement does not necessarily imply private ownership, but simply security of tenure. Families also require access to the tangible property necessary for personal and family support in order to be self-reliant, and they should have free access to public right-of-ways. These minimal rights related to property ensure to each individual the capacity to act on the choices made and receipt of the product or result of those choices.</p><p>In this domain as well as in the free exercise of conscience, societies may choose to articulate property rights beyond the minimum level just described. Property rights are commonly considered a group of rights, often described as similar to a bundle of sticks. Which specific rights are included in the bundle varies sharply across cultures and over time within the same culture. Again the precise adaptation of the “right and control of property” will depend on the voice of the people at a given time and place.</p><h3>Protection of Life</h3><p>At one level, the protection of life may seem the most straightforward of the three rights. It seems clear that individuals and families should be safe from violence either from the government or from others in the community. Murder, assault, all forms of abuse and other acts of violence should be prohibited and physical safety should be vigorously protected.</p><p>But it could well be argued that ignoring the nutritional needs of a starving individual is hardly protecting their life. Here again, though, the voice of the people may respond differently in different settings. It would certainly be conceivable that a society could choose to act collectively through government to establish safety nets to assure such things as adequate food, shelter and/or healthcare. Other societies may elect to meet these basic needs through the voluntary sector and the generosity of private individuals, depending on the will of the people. In all societies, voluntary associations of private individuals can provide a valuable expression of and extension to individual agency.</p><h2>Voluntary Associations</h2><p>The principles that guide the organization, management and conduct of voluntary associations should be grounded in the same three foundation principles: love of all stakeholders, respect for the individual agency of all stakeholders and individual accountability.</p><p>Love of all stakeholders implies that all members of the association place the well-being of other members on an equal footing with their own. The further implication therefore is that all members are respected and valued; that their contributions, concerns and needs are carefully weighed and their voices heard; and that actions taken by the organization will be in the best interest of all stakeholders.</p><p>Respect for individual agency and accountability implies that each stakeholder has a specific stewardship for some aspect of the association’s mission and a broader stewardship for the overall success of the organization and the well-being of all other stakeholders. Within the sphere established by this stewardship, each stakeholder is free to exercise their best judgment and efforts to further the interests of the association and other stakeholders. Each is accountable for both his or her specific stewardship and the achievement of the overall mission of the organization. Willingness to accept this responsibility is the definition of membership in a voluntary association and of citizenship in an involuntary community.</p><p>When an individual accepts employment within an organization, the employee enters into a contract with the employer in which the employee accepts certain constraints and requirements associated with the given job in exchange for the income and other benefits associated with regular work. Similarly, when a homebuyer purchases property included within a homeowner’s association, the terms and conditions of the buyer’s deed include restrictions on how the property may be used, how it must be maintained, etc. In exchange for accepting these restrictions on future choices, the property owner receives the benefits of belonging to the association which may include access to common properties and amenities maintained by the association. Thus, within voluntary organizations, it is often the case that individuals voluntarily choose to restrict their own (future) agency. Inevitably, people subject to restrictions on their agency, whether voluntary or not, encounter conflicts and trade-offs involving the basic rights of individuals.</p><h2>Conflicts, Trade-offs and Violations</h2><p>History has shown that conflicts between rights invariably emerge in communities. Some of these skirmishes result from misunderstandings regarding the nature of the rights involved. Others are more truly conflicts between community members over the relative priority of one right compared to another. Often such conflicts arise because the actions of one community member in pursuing their own interests have unintended or ill-considered effects on others. In such cases, the community must determine how to regulate the implementation and defense of the relative rights involved.  In all cases, societies should enact and enforce laws that defend the minimalist implementation of the three sets of rights regarding conscience, property and life as these are minimally essential for human development.</p><p>It is not possible to anticipate all possible conflicts nor to stipulate in the law how they should be addressed. Hence the need for competent public officials with integrity and high personal standards.</p><blockquote><p>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. (D&C 134:3)</p><p></p><p>Nevertheless, when the wicked rule the people mourn. Wherefore, honest men and wise men should be sought for diligently, and good men and wise men ye should observe to uphold; (D&C 98:9-10)</p></blockquote><h3>Taxes</h3><p>Taxation provides a useful domain in which to consider potential conflicts of rights and how they might be resolved. While taxes inherently infringe on individual agency by limiting property rights, some taxes would be necessary even in a system based largely on fees for service in order to pursue the public interest. A tax system grounded on the three basic axioms would have certain properties, including (but probably not limited to just these):</p><ul><li>It would discourage hoarding (based on love of others)</li><li>It would be completely transparent (based on accountability)</li><li>It would tax negative externalities in order to compensate those harmed (based on love of neighbors)</li><li>It would encourage voluntary redistribution by the relatively well-to-do (based on love of others)</li></ul><p>Specific taxes would likely work somewhat differently than at present in the U.S. The property tax would exempt some specified amount of value for residential and active commercial properties, but would provide no exemptions for 2<sup>nd</sup>homes, vacation homes, vacant commercial property or vacant land. To minimize hoarding of valuable land resources, such non-exempt properties might even be taxed at a higher rate in order to nudge owners to distribute land more evenly and use the land more productively.</p><p>To discourage the hoarding of financial resources and encourage voluntary redistribution, the income tax would be progressive exempting some basic income level and taxing the wealthy more heavily, but charitable contributions (voluntary redistribution) would be fully deductible. Both the income and the property tax would be designed to promote a more equal distribution of resources within a jurisdiction.</p><p>This is a very cursory consideration of how the implications of the three foundation principles might affect tax policy. It seems certain that other striking implications throughout public and private organizations could be identified and explored more fully.</p><h3>Violations</h3><p>Those living under a government have an obligation to abide by the laws of that government, else the rule of law has little meaning. President David O. McKay expressed that responsibility in these terms:</p><blockquote><p>The three significant words used in the 12<sup>th</sup>Article of Faith express the proper attitude of the membership of the Church toward law. These words are—obey, honor, and sustain. The Article does not say we believe in submission to the law. Obedience implies a higher attitude than mere submission, for obedience has its root in good intent; submission may spring from selfishness or meanness of spirit. Though obedience and submission both imply restraint on one’s own will, we are obedient only from a sense of right; submissive from a sense of necessity.</p><p></p><p>Honor expresses an act or attitude of an inferior towards a superior. When applied to things it is taken in the sense of holding in honor. Thus, in honoring the law, we look upon it as something which is above selfish desires or indulgences.</p><p></p><p>To sustain signifies to hold up; to keep from falling. To sustain the law, therefore, is to refrain from saying or doing anything which will weaken it or make it ineffective.<a href="http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn25" data-mce-href="#_edn25">[25]</a></p></blockquote><p>Breaking the law of the land subjects the perpetrator to sanctions, depending on the severity of the violations.</p><blockquote><p>We believe that all men are bound to sustain and uphold the respective governments in which they reside, while protected in their inherent and inalienable rights by the laws of such governments;</p><p></p><p>We believe that the commission of crime should be punished according to the nature of the offense; that murder, treason, robbery, theft, and the breach of the general peace, in all respects, should be punished according to their criminality and their tendency to evil among men, by the laws of that government in which the offense is committed; (D&C 134:5, 8)</p></blockquote><p>Violations of the contractual terms connected with voluntary associations are normally punishable by expulsion from the group unless the contract includes an advance agreement allowing for other sanctions. Such additional sanctions cannot extend to taking a life, or violation of other basic human rights. The sanctions are legitimized by the fact that the choice to become a member and to participate in the group was voluntary and was made with full knowledge of all terms and conditions of the relationship.</p><h2>Summary</h2><p>The purpose of this discussion has been to identify the basic principles on which the governance of all organizations should be based. It is argued that if the central purpose for mortality is considered to be maximizing human development, three principles emerge as paramount:</p><ul><li>Placing the well-being of all on an equal footing</li><li>Protecting the agency of individuals to make choices and act on those choices</li><li>Holding all individuals accountable for the consequences of their choices and actions</li></ul><p>In comparing the principles underlying the teachings of King Mosiah, the U.S. Constitution and the declaration of belief found in section 134, we argue that the three foundation principles are at the root of these sources. The U.S. Constitution in particular represents an inspired adaptation of the principles in the U.S. context while not precluding other somewhat different inspired adaptations in other settings.</p><p>Both involuntary and voluntary associations should possess many of the same attributes and governance of both should be grounded in the same three foundation principles. But because they are involuntary, governments involve an additional set of benefits that should be guaranteed to each individual. These include the protection of life, the protection of the ability to make personal choices in key life domains, and the protection of property, including the capacity to act on the choices made and the receipt of the product or result of those choices. In addition, each member of the involuntary association should enjoy the stability and certainty that come with the rule of law.</p><p>Governments have an obligation to enact and enforce laws that protect life, freedom of conscience, and the right and control of property precisely because it is through those three rights that the three foundation principles can be implemented in a society and human development maximized. How far any given society is willing to go in elaborating and implementing these rights, beyond a minimal standard relevant for all, is reserved to the people who live in that society.

We draw here on the five elements identified by Elder Oaks though they are presented in a slightly different order.<a href=\"http://www.goodgovernance.us/wp-admin/post.php?post=131&action=edit#_edn20\" data-mce-href=\"#_edn20\">[20]</a></p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"04a23310-0cf0-44b0-a2d0-37c5ee122cde","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"h3","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Popular sovereignty—","_html":"<h3><em>Popular sovereignty</em>—</h3>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"2cd09baf-ec6e-4076-ac8f-f43d02574572","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Quoting Elder Oaks, “Along with many religious people, Latter-day Saints affirm that God gave the power to the people, and the people consented to a constitution that delegated certain powers to the government.” The Constitution is an expression of the will of “We, the people,” and while certain powers are delegated to government, the people retain the ultimate agency to act and the accountability for our actions.","_html":"<p>Quoting Elder Oaks, “Along with many religious people, Latter-day Saints affirm that God gave the power to the people, and the people consented to a constitution that delegated certain powers to the government.” The Constitution is an expression of the will of “We, the people,” and while certain powers are delegated to government, the people retain the ultimate agency to act and the accountability for our actions.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"1dca3155-a439-4a00-ba00-c9bcc4ff93ef","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"quote","created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"According to the laws and constitution of the people, which I have suffered to be established, and should be maintained for the rights and protection of all flesh, according to just and holy principles; That every man may act in doctrine and principle pertaining to futurity, according to the moral agency which I have given unto him, that every man may be accountable for his own sins in the day of judgment.

Freedom of conscience then includes both individual and collective agency at least to the extent of free expression and dialogue, and personal practices that do not compel others or infringe on their rights.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"3c9110ef-2dc7-4a5b-b899-1cd75482674d","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Beyond this minimum, if supported by the popular will, citizens may choose to act through their government to cooperate and facilitate the development of individuals and groups within the population by providing for such things as:","_html":"<p>Beyond this minimum, if supported by the popular will, citizens may choose to act through their government to cooperate and facilitate the development of individuals and groups within the population by providing for such things as:</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"482153a9-2d5c-4c82-9670-1516562acdeb","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"list","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_html":"<ul><li>Basic and/or advanced education for all or part of the population</li><li>Legal requirements which assure equal opportunity for all</li><li>Physical infrastructure such as roads, waterways, etc., to promote the public interest</li><li>A market infrastructure including a common currency, public enforcement of private contracts, etc.</li></ul>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"03a931ae-1896-4d48-a1eb-3904e33d41d3","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"The only limiting factor on such exercises of collective agency is that all individuals retain certain property rights as discussed in the next section.","_html":"<p>The only limiting factor on such exercises of collective agency is that all individuals retain certain property rights as discussed in the next section.</p>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"d2186727-fbed-4dbc-971c-7f9cd45d3fa9","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"h3","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"Right and Control of Property","_html":"<h3>Right and Control of Property</h3>","metadata":{"isBasedOnUrl":null,"inLanguage":null,"starred":false,"inFeed":true,"hasPage":false,"inNav":false,"_description":"","keywords":[]}},{"id":"24e1d051-6321-4a41-9a7d-8a079d1ea2ec","item":"10d21cab-744d-4ad7-9abb-aed1818a5b0e","type":"text","src":null,"created_at":null,"updated_at":null,"_text":"It is possible to conceive of a society in which all social needs are met by voluntary contributions.
