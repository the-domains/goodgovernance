and that he holds men accountable for their acts in relation to them, both in making laws and administering them, for the good and safety of society.” (D&C 134:1)</p><p>A similar collective responsibility for the quality of government was instituted by King Mosiah when he, acting under divine commandment (Hel 4:22), transformed Nephite society from a monarchy to a system of elected judges, ruled ultimately by the consent of the governed. Not only were the judges to be selected by the “voice of the people,” but the people were given the power to “cause” any judge who failed in their administration of the law to be judged by other judges.</p><p><em>And now if ye have judges, and they do not judge you according to the law which has been given, ye can cause that they may be judged of a higher judge. If your higher judges do not judge righteous judgments, ye shall cause that a small number of your lower judges should be gathered together, and they shall judge your higher judges, according to the voice of the people. (Mosiah 29:28-29)</em></p><p>In a righteous system, therefore, the people are accountable for the overall quality of their government.</p><p>Individual agency is a foundational principle. Respecting this principle in an involuntary organization such as a government implies that organizational decisions should be made by the voice of the people. Rulers should be selected and sustained consistent with the popular will.</p><p><em>Therefore, choose you by the voice of this people, judges, that ye may be judged according to the laws which have been given you by our fathers, … (Mosiah 29:25)</em></p><p><em>We believe that all governments necessarily require civil officers and magistrates to enforce the laws of the same; and that such as will administer the law in equity and justice should be sought for and upheld by the voice of the people if a republic, or the will of the sovereign. (D&C 134:3)</em></p><p>We often hear discussed the connection between agency and individual accountability in the context of individual actions. Less common are discussions of accountability for the collective consequences of our collective actions. In this regard, the central question seems to concern the limitations placed on majority rule: What burdens, costs and requirements is the majority permitted to impose on a minority? As Elder Oaks noted, some of the most difficult questions we confront are regarding the limits of government. One of the central functions of the U.S. Constitution is to establish such limits within the American context. More generally, however, the collective agency of a people should be respected and sustained. Mosiah places great confidence in the voice of the people, thus respecting the collective agency of a people as well as individual agency.</p><p><em>Now it is not common that the voice of the people desireth anything contrary to that which is right; but it is common for the lesser part of the people to desire that which is not right; therefore this shall ye observe and make it your law—to do your business by the voice of the people. (Mosiah 29:26)</em></p><p>Taxation, one of the broadest intrusions on individual freedom and property, provides a useful example. A tax system could be designed wherein the people vote on which taxes to adopt and set the range of tax rates while their elected officials determine the final mix and rates necessary to meet fiscal needs. Potential taxes and tax bases could be defined in a publicly approved constitution. Rate ranges can be approved by the electorate. Final rates would be set by elected officials. If the overall tax burden becomes excessive, the “voice of the people” could change either the administration or the underlying laws and rates.</p><p>This example suggests the pattern for resolving this issue of majority power more broadly. Essentially, there are no theoretically imposed limits on what the majority might vote to do in curtailing the property rights of individuals, except that access to and control of property cannot be completely taken away from any individual (see the discussion of D&C 134 below). The agency of groups is expressed through “the voice of the people” and should be respected within the limits established to protect life, freedom of conscience and property rights.</p><p>Mosiah acted according to “that which the Lord commanded him to give unto the people.” (Hel 4:22) The Lord’s profound respect for collective agency and the voice of the people can be seen also in his response to the Prophet Samuel when the Israelites asked to have their system of government changed and a king installed. The Lord was not happy with their choice, but it was accepted as a valid exercise of collective agency.</p><p><em>But the thing displeased Samuel, when they said, Give us a king to judge us. And Samuel prayed unto the Lord. And the Lord said unto Samuel, Hearken unto the voice of the people in all that they say unto thee: for they have not rejected thee, but they have rejected me, that I should not reign over them. (1 Sam 8:6-7)</em></p><p>To be sure, there is collective accountability as well as agency. After expressing confidence in the voice of the people to make generally correct choices, Mosiah states:</p><p><em>And if the time comes that the voice of the people doth choose iniquity, then is the time that the judgments of God will come upon you; yea, then is the time he will visit you with great destruction even as he has hitherto visited this land. (Mosiah 29:27)</em></p><p>But imposing consequences for wrong collective choices does not in any way diminish the voice of the people as an expression of collective agency.</p></div></section></div><section id="3" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="46"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="47"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="48"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="49"><span data-reactid="50"><!-- react-empty: 51 --><h2 data-reactid="52"><a data-reactid="53">Good Governance</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="54"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="55"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="56"></div></div></div><div data-reactid="57"></div></section></div></div>
