<p>By their very nature, human organizations and institutions consist of individuals working in varying degrees of collaboration and cooperation. Opportunities are expanded and enhanced both in number and richness through this collaboration. With this view in mind, governance can be defined and conceptualized as follows:</p><p>Governance is the process we use to guide the co-production of opportunities and related instruction. It includes organizational and institutional decision-making, the selection and prioritization of goals and the allocation of resources in the creation of opportunities for individuals and the provision of information about those opportunities.</p><ul><li>From a social perspective, governance processes should contribute to and encourage the<strong>full realization of human potential</strong>or human flourishing.</li><li>Governance processes for organizations and institutions are<strong>constrained and disciplined by rules, laws,</strong><g data-gr-id="127">norms</g><strong>and values</strong>, both at the level of the decision makers and more broadly based on the social context in which the entity is located. (Organizations likewise attempt to influence social constraints.)</li><li>In light of the opportunities presented, the information available and accepted social constraints,<strong>individuals pursue the achievement of their own objectives</strong>.</li><li>Based in part on the perceived social and individual impact of an organization’s choices,<strong>decision makers may choose to modify their decisions</strong>regarding the purpose of the organization or institution, the goals to be pursued or resource allocation decisions.</li></ul><p>The following diagram summarizes the organization or institutional governance process and its relation to human flourishing.</p><p>Each of the elements in this conceptualization of governance is associated with a set of questions. The answers to these questions provide both a way to assess the quality of governance and guidance on how governance might be improved. The concept of “good governance” is embedded in the way these questions are answered in any given setting. The key questions are identified below.</p>undefined<h2>1. Constraints and Discipline</h2><ul><li>What rules, norms and other disciplines will apply in guiding and constraining the decisions and goals of the organization or institution?</li><li>How will these constraints and disciplines be enforced?</li></ul>undefined<h2>2. Decision Making</h2><ul><li>Who will have a say in the decision-making process?</li><li>What data are required to inform and support decision making? How will they be obtained?</li><li>How will the views and desires of legitimate participants be expressed and aggregated in the decision-making process?</li></ul>undefined<h2>3. Goal Identification</h2><p>It is common for organizations and institutions to endorse competing goals.</p><ul><li>How will conflicts between accepted goals be resolved and prioritized?</li></ul>undefined<h2>4. Resource Allocation</h2><p>Goal selection and prioritization<g data-gr-id="117">is</g>translated into the allocation of resources. In many instances, the same goal can be pursued through different alternatives. Many times those charged with implementing resource allocation decisions have their own goals and agendas which are not fully consistent with the intent of decision makers.</p><ul><li>How will alternatives for allocating resources be identified and evaluated?</li><li>How will incompatible organizational and personal agendas be managed?</li></ul>undefined<h2>5. Opportunities</h2><p>One result of organizational resource allocation decisions is the creation of opportunities.</p><ul><li>For which humans are the created opportunities available and relevant?</li><li>Are the opportunities created specific to individuals or are<g data-gr-id="96">they</g>opportunities for groups taken as a whole?</li><li>Does taking advantage of collective opportunities result in individualized harms? Are such individualized harms consistent with the established constraints and disciplines?</li><li>Does taking advantage of individualized opportunities result in collective harms? Are such collective harms consistent with the established constraints and disciplines?</li></ul>undefined<h2>6. Instruction</h2><p>Without information/instructions related to the opportunities created, they are of little use. Consequently, resource allocation decisions also result in information and instruction regarding opportunities.</p><ul><li>For which humans is the instruction available and relevant?</li><li>Is the instruction specific to individuals or is it provided to groups taken as a whole?</li><li>How much instruction is required to understand the implications of the opportunities?</li><li>How much instruction is sufficient for individuals to make informed choices?</li><li>When do information and instruction become manipulative and coercive thereby undermining individual agency?</li></ul><h2>7. The Feedback Loop</h2><p>Individuals are responsible for their own choices and actions. These choices are, however, made in the context created by social institutions and in response to opportunities and information provided by organizations and institutions.</p><ul><li>To what extent and how is an organization or institution accountable for the achieved level of human flourishing?</li><li>How can those affected by an organizational or institutional decision influence its formulation and administration?</li></ul><p>Adding these key questions to the figure above both summarizes the concept of governance and outlines the central evaluation and research questions related to governance.</p></div></section></div><section id="Footer3col" class="Section Section--components-2 Section--footer color-bg color-title z-30 p-1 ls-p-h-2vw  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="41"><div class="fx-1 bd-none ls-bd-r ls-bd-w-1" data-reactid="42"><div class="Group Group-heading ls-p-r-4" data-reactid="43"><div class="Site-title color-text-pop" data-reactid="44"><span data-reactid="45"><!-- react-empty: 46 --><h2 data-reactid="47"><a href="index.html" data-reactid="48">What is Good Governance?</a></h2></span></div></div></div><div class="fx-1" data-reactid="49"><div class="Group Group--links" data-reactid="50"><div class="Group Group--links f-s-m ls-f-s-s w-s-wrap ls-w-s-nowrap" data-reactid="51"></div></div></div></section></div></div>
